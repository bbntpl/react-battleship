# Battleship
It's a recreation of the old classic game called [Battleship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)) as a simple webpage game. Canvas tag is mainly used for the battle gameboards.

### Rules
Place your ships and destroy the enemy ships. As simple as that. 

### Ships
These are the following ships exactly as the classes of ships from the old game.
| Classes | Size |
| ------- | -----|
| Carrier | 5    |
| Battleship | 4 |
| Cruiser | 3 |
| Submarine | 3 |
| Destroyer | 2 |

### Gamemodes 
There are two gamemodes: Player vs Player (PvP) and Player vs AI with an implementation of two different difficulties. Additionally, a gamemode AI vs AI is included specifically for debugging purposes or just to have fun with coded implementations.
